# Nonlinear Dynamics and Complex Systems with Julia

> **Currently still work in progress!**

The material of this repository accompany a fully hands-on, semester-long lecture series on computational modeling and analysis of nonlinear dynamics and complex systems. It is a guided tour of many packages of the [JuliaDynamics](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/) software organization, which offers accessible, well-documented, and highly-performant software to perform modeling and analysis within the realms of nonlinear dynamics and complex systems. Part of the lecture series is also an extensive introduction to the Julia programming language (assuming already existing programming familiarity), as well as demonstration of usage of other Julia packages that are not part of the JuliaDynamics organization.

The material here is largely based on the textbook [_Nonlinear Dynamics: a concise introduction interlaced with code_](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-91032-7). We consider this textbook to be about 80% teaching nonlinear dynamics and complex systems concepts, and about 20% on using code to compute these concepts in practice. The _Nonlinear Dynamics and Complex Systems with Julia_ lecture hosted on this GitHub page is flipped: it is about 20% teaching of concepts and 80% coding: the concepts are introduced at a small level of detail so that there is motivation to compute them in practice, but the main focus is how the software packages work, and how to use them, to perform computations.

As such, this lecture series can be combined with the aforementioned textbook to create a deep level of expertise which encompasses not only knowledge and understanding, but also the practical skills necessary to efficiently utilize this understanding in practice.
