This is called a **recurrence**. The `AttractorsViaRecurrences` utilizes this fact to find attractors by tesselating a finite region of the state space into finite-sized cells, and coungint cells that have re-visited.\n",

    "Another typical measure of global stability is the **minimal fatal shock** (MFS), that is, the perturbation of least mangitude we need to do on a state to push the state into a basin of another attractor. In Attractors.jl the function `minimal_fatal_shock` computes this quantity for _any_ dynamical system. This is a huge improvement over the paper that originally introduced the concept, as there it was only possible to compute for a very specific class of dynamical systems.\n",
