    "\n",
    "In this block we will go through a basic tutorial for Agents.jl. Another basic introduction can be found [online based on the Schelling model](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/examples/schelling/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up an ABM simulation in Agents.jl, a user only needs to follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose** in what kind of **space** the agents will live in, for example a graph, a grid, etc. [Several spaces are provided by Agents.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/api/#Available-spaces-1) and can be initialized immediately.\n",
    "2. **Define** the **agent type** (or types, for mixed models) that will populate the ABM. Agent types are standard Julia `mutable struct`s. They can be created manually, but typically you'd want to use [`@agent`](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/tutorial/#.-The-agent-type(s)-1). The types must contain some mandatory fields, which is ensured by using `@agent`. The remaining fields of the agent type are up to user's choice.\n",
    "3. The created agent type, the chosen space, optional additional model level properties, and other simulation tuning properties like schedulers or random number generators, are given to [`AgentBasedModel`](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/tutorial/#Agents.AgentBasedModel). This instance **defines the model** within an Agents.jl simulation.\n",
    "4. Provide functions that govern the **time evolution of the ABM**. A user can provide an agent-stepping function, that acts on each agent one by one, and/or a model-stepping function, that steps the entire model as a whole. These functions are standard Julia functions that take advantage of the [Agents.jl API](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/api/). Once these functions are created, they are simply passed to [`step!`](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/tutorial/#.-Evolving-the-model-1) to evolve the model.\n",
    "5. _(Optional)_ [**Visualize the model and animate its time evolution**.](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/agents_visualizations/) This can help checking that the model behaves as expected and there aren't any mistakes, or can be used in making figures for a paper/presentation.\n",
    "6. **Collect data**. To do this, specify which data should be collected, by providing one standard Julia `Vector` of data-to-collect for agents, for example `[:mood, :wealth]`, and another one for the model. The agent data names are given as the keyword `adata` and the model as keyword `mdata` to the function [`run!`](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/tutorial/#Agents.run!). This function outputs collected data in the form of a `DataFrame`."

    "For some starting configurations the rabbit-fox model leads to partial or total species death. Continue from the above function `plot_population_timeseries` and play around with different keywords (starting parameters for the model). Record one set of parameters where both rabbits and foxes survive and oscillate around equilibrium values, on set of parameters where foxes die out but rabbits survive, and one set of parameters where both species become extinct."

    "* The model will have no spatial property. There is no need to provide a secon `space` argument to `AgentBasedModel`. In this case, the agents are defined using `@agent` inherit from the `NoSpaceAgent` type.\n",
    "* The population is composed of `n` haploid individuals. The main property of each agent is `trait`, which will represent the fitness of the agent on a range from 0 to 1.\n",
    "* The agents will be activated randomly in the model. Therefore, we need to seed the simulation to make it reproducible. In addition, we would like for our model to be initialized with the property `population_size`, in order to freely modify the amount of individuals in the population.\n",
